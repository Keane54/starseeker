To run the project, clone it, enter the root directory and create a `.env` file.

Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into the `.env` file and assign an `API_KEY` and `API_URL` to their respective variables.

Run `npm i` to install dependencies. 

Then run `npm run build` to build the project and `npm start` to start the server.

Alternatively to run in development mode use `npm run dev` to start the development server.

To run the tests use `npm test`, to see results in a UI use `npm test:ui`.
